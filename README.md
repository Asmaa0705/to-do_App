# To-Do List App 📝

A minimal Flutter app that helps users manage daily tasks. Built as part of my Flutter learning journey.

## 📱 Features

- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Display current task list
- Show message when the list is empty
- Clean, responsive UI

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Flutter** (UI framework)
- **Dart** (programming language)
- **State Management**: `setState`

## 📂 Project Structure

```
lib/
├── main.dart        # App entry point
├── models/          # Task model
└── screens/         # Home screen
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Make sure Flutter is installed and configured.

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## 💡 What I Learned

- Managing state with `setState`
- Working with `TextField`, `ListView`, and `ElevatedButton`
- Basic layout widgets: `Padding`, `Row`, `Column`, `Expanded`, `SizedBox`
- UI logic separation

## ✅ Next Steps

- Task deletion
- Persistent storage (e.g., shared_preferences)
- Task categories and filtering
